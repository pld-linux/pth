  # fix handling/casting of "int (*)(void *)" callback functions.
  # use gcc 3.3 option "-fno-strict-aliasing" (if available) under

    contains important and correct pointer casting constructs which
    are not acceptable in "strict aliasing" for gcc.

- optimizations enabled.
- url added.
- release 1.
